			<div class = "content-left">
			<p>The app includes different functions to make greener choices more appealing. One of the easiest steps for most people is to choose walking, instead of driving. This is easier said than done, but could be a more of a tempting offer if you got something in return. The app uses GPS to track when you are walking or cycling. It does this by looking at the speed that you’re going, and it makes sure that you are not on the freeway. After your walk the app will give you points based on the distance. The app cooperate with several companies, including bakeries, kiosk's and more. You can use the points you gain to get discounts and free products from the different companies. More points equals more discounts. We believe that this will get more people to choose walking by making it exciting, as well as it being a social thing where you can compete about having the most points with your friends.</p><br>

			<h2 class = "overskrift"><a tabindex="12">Choose the right garbage can</h2></a>

			<p>If you have something that you’re going to throw away it can sometimes be confusing to know which garbage can it is supposed to go in. The solution is using your camera to scan the barcode, or simply searching for the item. The app will then show you what recycling category your product is in, along with a map showing the nearest correct bin to throw it in. The app will perhaps not recognize every product, but you can search for a similar one. We are continuously updating the app with new products as they come on the market. On the map you can also see where to recycle glass, metal, and rare things like electrical waste. In addition you can see were the closest place to give away or recycle old clothes. With all these helpful functions gathered in one app we hope to decrease wrong recycling and increase people’s knowledge about what goes where. </p><br>

			<h2 class = "overskrift"><a tabindex="13">Choose the sustainable products</h2></a>
			<p>Picture yourself going to the store and buying groceries. You don’t know anything about the different producers, which can lead you to buying products from companies which are unethical or that pollute heavily. In the app you can search e.g “Chicken”, and the result shows you the best products to buy. The ranking is, among other things, based on how much plastic is used, additives and how the animals are treated. This will also increase the knowledge about what to choose, which people can continue to share. </p><b2>

			

			<h2 class = "overskrift"><a tabindex="14">Don’t forget a shopping/trash bag</h2></a>
			<p>Many people buy a new plastic bag every time they are at the store, even though they may have plenty at home. The reason for this can simply be that you forgot to bring one, and that is something this app will try to change. You can tell the app when you plan on going to the store, and you will get a notification that reminds you to bring a bag. In the profile settings in the app you can add where you live. If you go outside the app gives you a notification saying “Going to the store? Remember to bring a bag!”. By having this reminder, you won’t have to worry about forgetting a bag ever again.</br>
			In Oslo the trash is sorted based on the color of the bag. You can find information about the different colors in the app, as well as seeing where you can get new ones. It’s also possible to tell the app that you are out of bags. With the GPS your phone can notify you when you’re near a store that sells the bags. Then you will not use the wrong bags because you forgot to get new ones.

			</p><br>

			<h2 class = "overskrift"><a tabindex="15">Financing the app</h2></a>

			<p>To finance the app we will firstly ask the companies that produce sustainable products to invest. The sustainable products will ass explained above be featured in our app. More people will therefore buy these products, which will earn the companies more money. We will also ask different stores such as 7eleven and Narvesen to both invest and cooperate with us. If you can use your walking points in these stores it will help both parties. They will hopefully get more customers, and also support a greener world.  </p>

			<h2 class = "overskrift"><a tabindex="16">Website design</h2></a>
			<p>We know that people use different screens and browsers. Because of this we have spent time making sure that the website is user-friendly to reach as many people as possible. This includes that the website work just as well on your phone as it does on your computer, regardless of the browser. You can also use the tab-button to navigate on the site, if you need or want to use that function. Our target group for this project is young people, and that’s why we have created a facebook-page and an Instagram-account. </p>
