			<p class = "text-with-photo">The app includes different functions to make greener choices more appealing. One of the easiest steps for most people is to choose walking, instead of driving. This is easier said than done, but could be a more tempting of a tempting offer if you got something in return. Therefore, the app uses gps to track when you are walking or cycling. It does this by looking at the speed that you’re going, and it makes sure that you are not on the freeway. After your walk the app will give you points based on the distance, and because of the apps collaborations with companies you can use these points to for example get discounts on various products. We believe that this will get more people to choose walking by making it exciting, as well as it being a social thing where you can compete with your friends.</p><br>

			<p class = "text-with-photo">If you have something that you’re going to throw away it can sometimes be confusing to know which to do this. The solution is using your camera to scan the barcode, or simply searching for the item. The app will then show you what recycling category this product is, along with a map showing the nearest place to do it. The app will maybe not recognize every product, but you can search for a similar one. We are updating the app with new products regularly. On the map you can also see where to recycle glass, metal, and also more rare things like electrical waste. You can also see where the nearest place you can hand in your old clothes. With all these helpful functions gathered in one app we hope to decrease wrong recycling and increase people’s knowledge about what goes where. </p><br>

			<img class = "pic" src = "food.jpg" alt = "Recyable food"/>

			<p class = "text-with-photo">Picture yourself buying a product, for example food. You don’t know anything about the different producers, which can lead to buying products by companies who are unethical or heavily pollute. In the app you can search “Chicken”, which results in showing the best products to buy. The ranking is, among other things, based on how much plastic is used, additives and how the animals are treated. This will also increase the knowledge about what to choose, which people can continue to share. </p><br>

			

			<p class = "text-with-photo">Many people take a new plastic bag every time they are at the store, even though they maybe have plenty at home. The reason for this can simply be that you forgot it, and that’s something this app will try to change. You can add a notification saying when you plan to go to the store, so you don’t forget. You can also ass a radius around where you live, and if you go outside this the app gives you a notification saying “Going to the store? Remember to bring a bag!”. By having this reminder, you won’t have to worry about forgetting a bag again. </p><br>

			<img class = "pic" src = "people-recycling.jpg" alt = "A happy family who are recycling"/>

			<p class = "text-with-photo">In Oslo the trash is sorted based on the color of the bag. You can find information about the different colors in the app, as well as seeing where you can get new ones. It’s also possible to use a function saying that you’re out of bags. With the gps you phone can notify you when you’re nearby a store where you can get new bags. Then you won’t come home using the wrong bags because you forgot to get new ones. </p>
